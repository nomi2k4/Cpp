# Text Encryption and Decryption Program

A simple C++ program that encrypts and decrypts text using a key-based shifting technique combined with stack operations.

## Overview
This program allows users to encrypt or decrypt a given text using a secret key. The key is expanded to match the text length, characters are shifted forward or backward based on the key, and a stack is used to reverse the text during the process.

## Features
- Encrypt text using a key  
- Decrypt encrypted text using the same key  
- Key expansion to match text length  
- Character shifting for encryption and decryption  
- Stack implementation using linked list  
- Menu-driven user interface  

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW)  
- Standard C++ libraries (`iostream`, `string`)
