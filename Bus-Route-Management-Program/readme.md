# Bus Route Management Program

A simple C++ program that manages bus routes by allowing a driver to add, remove, and search routes using basic class-based design.

## Overview

## Features
- Add new bus routes  
- Remove existing bus routes  
- Search routes by bus number  
- Fixed-size storage for routes  
- Menu-driven user interface  

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW)  
- Standard C++ libraries (`iostream`, `string`)
