# Triangle Pattern Printer Program

A simple C++ program that prints a triangle pattern using asterisks (*) with the help of nested loops.

## Overview
This program uses nested `for` loops to generate a triangle pattern. The outer loop controls the number of rows, while the inner loop controls the number of asterisks printed in each row, decreasing with each new line.

## Features
- Uses nested `for` loops  
- Generates a triangle pattern using asterisks (*)  
- Demonstrates basic pattern printing logic  
- Clear and easy-to-understand output  

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)  
- Standard C++ libraries (e.g., iostream)
