# Character Type Identifier Program

A simple C++ program that identifies the type of a character input by the user.

## Overview
This program prompts the user to input a character, checks if it is an alphabet using `isalpha()`, determines if it is uppercase or lowercase using `isupper()`, converts it to lowercase with `tolower()`, identifies it as a vowel or consonant using a switch statement, and displays the character type.

## Features
- User input for a character
- Conditional statements for character type identification
- Uses `isalpha()`, `isupper()`, and `tolower()` functions
- Switch statement for vowel/consonant identification
- Clear and informative output

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
