# Alarm Sound and Pause Program

A simple C++ program that produces an alarm sound multiple times and pauses after each sound until the user presses Enter.

## Overview
This program was written to practice basic C++ concepts.  
It uses a loop to produce an alarm sound 100 times, prints a symbol on the screen, and waits for user input before continuing to the next iteration.

## Features
- Uses a `for` loop to repeat actions
- Produces alarm sound using the `\a` escape sequence
- Displays an exclamation mark after each sound
- Pauses execution using user input (`cin.get()`)

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
