# Fuel Consumption Calculator Program

A simple C++ program that calculates the estimated fuel consumption for a given distance in miles, both in-town and on-highway.

## Overview
The program prompts the user to input the distance in miles, calculates fuel consumption for in-town (0.0465 gallons/mile) and on-highway (0.0373 gallons/mile), and displays the results.

## Features
- User input for distance in miles  
- Calculates in-town and on-highway fuel consumption  
- Displays the results clearly  

## Assumptions
- In-town fuel consumption rate: 0.0465 gallons/mile  
- On-highway fuel consumption rate: 0.0373 gallons/mile  

## How to Run
1. Copy the C++ code into a `.cpp` file  
2. Compile using a C++ compiler  
3. Run the executable and enter the distance when prompted  

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)  
- Standard C++ libraries (e.g., iostream)
