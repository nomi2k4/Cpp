# Computer Component Program

A simple C++ program that simulates computer components, specifically CPU and RAM. It demonstrates the creation, manipulation, and display of CPU and RAM information.

## Overview
This program allows creating CPU objects with clock speed and core count, and RAM objects with memory capacity.  
It allows setting and retrieving CPU and RAM properties and displays their information.

## Features
- Creates CPU objects with clock speed and core count
- Creates RAM objects with memory capacity
- Allows setting and retrieving CPU and RAM properties
- Displays CPU and RAM information

## Requirements
- C++ compiler
- Standard C++ libraries (e.g., iostream, string)
