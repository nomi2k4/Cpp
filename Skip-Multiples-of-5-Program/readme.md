# Skip Multiples of 5 Program

A simple C++ program that prints numbers from 1 to 50, skipping multiples of 5.

## Overview
The program uses a while loop to iterate through numbers 1 to 50, checks for multiples of 5, and skips them using the `continue` statement. Non-multiples of 5 are printed.

## Features
- Looping structure using while loop  
- Conditional statement for checking multiples of 5  
- Use of `continue` statement to skip multiples of 5  
- Clear and informative output  

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)  
- Standard C++ libraries (e.g., iostream)
