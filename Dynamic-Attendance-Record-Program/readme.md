# Dynamic Attendance Record Program  

A simple C++ program that maintains a dynamic attendance record for students using their roll numbers. The list automatically resizes when it reaches capacity.

## Features  
- Insert student roll numbers  
- Automatically resize the list when capacity is reached  
- Remove a roll number from the attendance record  
- Search for a roll number  
- Display all roll numbers currently in the attendance record  
- Track current size and total capacity of the list  

## Requirements  
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW)  
- Standard C++ library (`iostream`)
