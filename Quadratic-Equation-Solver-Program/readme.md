# Quadratic Equation Solver Program

A simple C++ program that solves quadratic equations of the form ax² + bx + c = 0.

## Overview
The program prompts the user to input coefficients a, b, and c, calculates the discriminant (b² - 4ac), and displays the roots. It handles real and distinct, real and equal, and complex roots.

## Features
- User input for coefficients a, b, and c  
- Calculation of discriminant using arithmetic operations  
- Conditional statements to determine the nature of the roots  
- Clear and informative output  

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)  
- Standard C++ libraries (e.g., iostream, cmath)
