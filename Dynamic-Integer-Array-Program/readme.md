# Dynamic Integer Array Program  

A simple C++ program that implements a dynamic integer array with automatic resizing when the array reaches its capacity.

## Overview  
This program allows users to store integer values in a dynamically allocated array. When the array becomes full, it automatically increases its capacity by a fixed amount (5 in this case). Users can insert values and display all stored integers.

## Features  
- Insert integer values into the array  
- Automatically resize the array when capacity is reached  
- Display all stored integers  
- Track current size and total capacity of the array  

## Requirements  
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW)  
- Standard C++ library (`iostream`)
