# Sensor Data Dynamic Array Program  

A simple C++ program that implements a dynamic array to store temperature sensor readings, with automatic resizing when the array reaches capacity.

## Overview  
This program allows users to insert temperature readings into a dynamically allocated array. If the array becomes full, it automatically doubles its capacity. Users can view all stored readings, and the program keeps track of the current size and total capacity of the array.

## Features  
- Insert new temperature readings  
- Automatically resize the array when capacity is reached  
- Display all temperature readings  
- Track current size and total capacity of the array  

## Requirements  
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW)  
- Standard C++ library (`iostream`)
