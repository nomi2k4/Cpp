# Circular Linked List Program

A simple C++ program that implements a circular singly linked list with basic operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

## Overview
This program allows users to work with a circular linked list where the last node points back to the head node. Users can insert nodes at the head, tail, or after a specific target, search for nodes, remove nodes, and display the list contents using a menu-driven interface.

## Features
- Check if the list is empty  
- Insert nodes at the head  
- Insert nodes at the tail  
- Insert nodes after a target value  
- Search for a node  
- Remove a node  
- Print all elements of the circular linked list  

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, MinGW)  
- Standard C++ library (`iostream`)
