# Simple Calculator Program Using Functions

A simple C++ program that implements a basic calculator using functions for arithmetic operations.

## Overview
The program prompts the user to input two numbers, presents a menu with options for basic arithmetic operations (sum, subtract, product, division), calls corresponding functions to perform calculations based on user choice, and outputs the result.

## Features
- User input for numbers and operation choice  
- Functions for basic arithmetic operations (sum, subtract, product, division)  
- Switch statement for handling menu options  
- Clear and informative output  

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)  
- Standard C++ libraries (e.g., iostream)
